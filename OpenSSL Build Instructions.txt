1.  Clone the OpenSSL git repository
2.  Checkout the appropriate version (failure to do this will compile HEAD, which may be unstable)
3.  Install Strawberry Perl
4.  Install NASM
5.  Add NASM to PATH (Strawberry Perl added iteself to PATH upon install)
6.  Launch the Visual Studio Command Prompt (64-bit) by bringing up the Start Menu and typing "x64 Native Tools ...".  Be sure to launch as administrator.
7.  Navigate to the root OpenSSL directory
8.  Configure using:
    perl Configure VC-WIN64A --prefix="D:/lib/openssl/" --openssldir="D:/lib/openssl/" no-shared
    (Note use of forward slashes in path specification)
9.  Verify correct MSCRT was selected by opening "makefile" in root OpenSSL directory and checking contents of LIB_CFLAGS variable (I checked to make sure it had /MT)
10.  Execute "nmake"
11. Exectue "nmake test"
12. Execute "nmake install"
